EXTRA CREDIT SHAPES:
new shape: triangle
try command line:
$bash ./hw1.out input_file.txt output_file.txt 16(this is irrelevant) triangle_full_justify/triangle_left_flush/triangle right flush

eg:./hw1.out long_word.txt long_word_output_full.txt 16 triangle_full_justify
and it output:
		 /\
	        /S-\
	       /upe-\
	      /rcali-\
	     /fragili-\
	    /sticexpia-\
	   /lidocious!  \
	  /Even    though\
	 /the  sound of it\
       /is something quite\
      /atrocious!   If  you\
     /say  it  loud  enough,\
    /you'll    always   sound\
   /precocious,               \
  /Supercalifragilisticexpiali-\
 /docious!                      \
/________________________________\ 


It look like that because I just want to make it look perfect on submitty
but on terminal or txt reader it should look like that:

		        /\
	           /S-\
	          /upe-\
	         /rcali-\
	        /fragili-\
	       /sticexpia-\
	      /lidocious!  \
	     /Even    though\
	    /the  sound of it\
       /is something quite\
      /atrocious!   If  you\
     /say  it  loud  enough,\
    /you'll    always   sound\
   /precocious,               \
  /Supercalifragilisticexpiali-\
 /docious!                      \
